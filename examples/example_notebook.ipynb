    "# Draft Email for IT Department - API Key Request\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subject:** Request for Azure OpenAI API Access for ThemeFinder Project\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**To:** IT Support / Cloud Services Team  \n",
    "**From:** [Your Name]  \n",
    "**Date:** [Today's Date]  \n",
    "**Subject:** Request for Azure OpenAI API Access for ThemeFinder Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Dear IT Team,\n",
    "\n",
    "I am working on implementing **ThemeFinder**, an AI-powered topic modeling tool for analyzing survey responses and public consultation feedback. This tool will help our department process citizen feedback more efficiently and identify key themes in public responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Overview:**\n",
    "- **Tool:** ThemeFinder (Python package for topic modeling)\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Automated analysis of survey responses and consultation data\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Processing public feedback to identify themes and sentiment for policy makers\n",
    "- **Repository:** https://github.com/i-dot-ai/themefinder/\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required API Access:**\n",
    "I need access to Azure OpenAI services with the following configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Azure OpenAI (Preferred)**\n",
    "- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` - API key for our Azure OpenAI resource\n",
    "- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - Endpoint URL (format: https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/)\n",
    "- `OPENAI_API_VERSION` - API version (recommend: 2024-02-15-preview)\n",
    "- `DEPLOYMENT_NAME` - Name of GPT-4o deployment\n",
    "- `AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL` - Base URL (same as endpoint)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: OpenAI Direct (Alternative)**\n",
    "- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Direct OpenAI API key\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Requirements:**\n",
    "- Model access to GPT-4o or GPT-4 for optimal performance\n",
    "- The tool supports structured outputs and works with various LLM providers\n",
    "- Estimated usage: [specify your expected volume, e.g., \"processing 200-500 responses per analysis\"]\n",
    "- Environment: Development container setup with secure credential management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Considerations:**\n",
    "- All API keys will be stored in `.env` files (not committed to version control)\n",
    "- Development environment uses secure container isolation\n",
    "- Tool is designed for government/public sector use with appropriate data handling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Justification:**\n",
    "This tool will significantly improve our ability to:\n",
    "- Process large volumes of public consultation responses efficiently\n",
    "- Identify key themes and sentiment in citizen feedback automatically\n",
    "- Provide structured insights for policy decision-making\n",
    "- Reduce manual analysis time from days/weeks to hours\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "Could you please advise on:\n",
    "1. The process for requesting Azure OpenAI access for our department\n",
    "2. Any security approvals or data governance requirements\n",
    "3. Whether we have existing Azure OpenAI resources I can use\n",
    "4. Timeline for provisioning access\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm happy to provide additional technical details or meet to discuss this request further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for your assistance.\n",
